## Dhuin Review

This is a film i just randomly found when i was searching for movies set in Bihar. I am fascinated by the place, it seems like a lot of Indians hate that place (both North and South India for different reasons) so, I was a little curious about the place and the culture. That's why i started to watch films set in Bihar. The other 2 films I've watched from there was the Gangs of wasseypur duology, and i really enjoyed those two but it wasn't directed by a Bihari person. I searched in Letterboxd yesterday about it and this seemed like the film with the highest rating that was both set in Bihar and directed by a Bihari person. 

Now, lets talk about the film. It's only got 50 minute runtime and the film is largely about this struggling actor in Bihar trying to make ends meet. I mean, there's more to it than that but that's pretty much the gist of it. The presentation of the film is quite believable in the sense that there isnt any bollywood-esque scene or anything like that and there are these long drawn out shots with no background music and most of the time, it's just the characters talking to each other. You can also see the clear Kiarotsmi influence in this film just the way its presented. 
Do i like this film? Yeah kinda, i think it was a small but fun watch, now do i say i love it? no. there are aspects of the story i feel like had so much potential to go somewhere but it didn't. I can understand why because of the short runtime but if it was much longer I'd definitely would've watched that. I also think the story could've fleshed out its main character or give him more depth to actually get the viewer to care about him but again due to the runtime none of it was possible. However, there was this one brilliant scene and i feel this is central to the film and porbably one of my favorite show dont tell sequences in film. It was this scene where the film nerds are talking about meeting kiarotsmi and just discussing nerdy stuff in general and when one of the guys ask the question to MC about what does he think about artists having limitations, he couldnt answer and then he walks down the street with frustration. that's the scene. that scene really resonated with me because i was in that spot quite a lot of times in my life, where i couldn't answer to a simple question because i couldn't think out of the box or didn't have the necessary tools to do so. I was quite dogmatic with my thinking at those times and i want to improve that. Overall, i thought it was a really cool short film.
